        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My love affair with computers began in childhood, but my path wasn't straightforward. I studied mechanical engineering at K.L. University, where options for computer science were limited in my region. It was during my third year when I discovered a specialized course in Data Structures and Algorithms that changed everything.</p>
        
        <p>Working twice as hard as my classmates, I became the only mechanical engineering student to secure a software developer position after graduation. This transition from mechanical engineering to becoming a self-taught developer has shaped how I approach problems—with a blend of analytical mechanical thinking and creative coding solutions.</p>
        
        <p>I still remember the exact moment when I realized my self-taught knowledge wasn't enough. It was late at night at Beamx Techlabs, struggling with optimizing queries for a knowledge graph application. Despite hours researching online and trying different approaches, the solution remained elusive. This humbling experience became a turning point in my journey.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I'm constantly exploring the boundaries of my knowledge, particularly in graph databases, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence. Each challenge has become an opportunity to delve deeper into the theoretical foundations that underpin our technological world.</p>

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        
        <h3>Knowledge Graphs & Graph Databases</h3>
        <p>I'm fascinated by how knowledge graphs represent information in ways that mirror human understanding. My experience working with Apache AGE and implementing graph schemas has shown me both the immense potential and the complex challenges in this field. I'm particularly interested in optimizing graph database queries and developing more efficient knowledge graph technologies.</p>
        
        <h3>Distributed Systems Architecture</h3>
        <p>The elegance of distributed computing—how independent components work together to create resilient, scalable systems—has captivated my attention. My work with serverless architectures using AWS Lambda has given me practical insights, while leaving me hungry for deeper theoretical understanding of the underlying principles.</p>
        
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Search Algorithms</h3>
        <p>I'm drawn to the intersection of AI and information retrieval. Implementing search capabilities with MeiliSearch has shown me how good search transforms user experiences. I'm eager to explore more advanced machine learning approaches to search and recommendation systems that can make information more accessible.</p>
        
        <p class="quote">My goal extends beyond personal achievement—I aim to develop more efficient knowledge graph technologies and distributed computing architectures that make advanced AI systems more accessible and sustainable.</p>

        <h2>Learning Through Building</h2>
        
        <div class="project">
            <h3>W6H: A Journey into Knowledge Graphs</h3>
            <p>This project began with a simple question: how can we connect structured and unstructured data in more intuitive ways? Using Rust's Axum framework, I built a RESTful API that bridged Apache AGE for graph relationships with CouchDB for document storage.</p>
            
            <p>The challenge of learning multiple database paradigms simultaneously and developing efficient cross-database queries pushed me to my limits. When the system successfully scaled to handle over 10,000 daily requests, it was both a professional achievement and a personal revelation about the power of graph-based data models.</p>

            <h3>Axiom Cloud: Lessons in Distributed Systems</h3>
            <p>What started as a simple email service evolved into a fascinating exploration of asynchronous processing. I designed a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, SQS, S3, and SES that elegantly handled unpredictable traffic spikes—something I once would have approached with traditional scaling.</p>
            
            <p>This project taught me valuable lessons about distributed systems: how components communicate, how to manage state across services, and how to design for failure. Each optimization revealed deeper questions about theoretical concepts I'm now eager to explore more formally.</p>

            <h3>Knowledge Graph POC: From Theory to Practice</h3>
            <p>This experimental project allowed me to implement complex graph schemas in a practical context. By adapting the Cars schema from Schema.org, I created a network of nodes and relationships that represented automotive data in ways traditional databases couldn't match.</p>
            
            <p>The most rewarding aspect was seeing how naturally graph databases model complex real-world relationships. The challenges I faced with query optimization highlighted the gap between practical implementations and theoretical understanding that I'm working to bridge.</p>

        <h2>Reflections & Vision</h2>
        
        <h3>The Power of Foundational Knowledge</h3>
        <p>My journey from self-taught programmer to solutions architect has shown me that while tutorials can teach you syntax, true mastery requires understanding the underlying principles. I've learned that knowing "how" is only the beginning—understanding "why" is what unlocks innovation.</p>
        
        <h3>Making Advanced Technology Accessible</h3>
        <p>I believe that the most powerful technologies should be accessible beyond specialized research environments. My vision is to develop knowledge graph technologies and distributed systems that are not only powerful but also approachable for developers with diverse backgrounds—much like my own.</p>
        
        <h3>Continuous Learning as a Way of Life</h3>
        <p>Beyond my professional work, I maintain a disciplined approach to learning. From exploring Linux systems to studying cloud architecture patterns and new programming languages, I see each exploration as adding another dimension to my understanding of computing.</p>
        
        <p class="quote">That moment of frustration when I couldn't solve the knowledge graph query problem wasn't just a professional setback—it was a turning point that clarified my path forward. With determination and curiosity, I continue to seek deeper understanding of the technologies that fascinate me.</p>
