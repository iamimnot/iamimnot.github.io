                <p class="drop-cap reveal-text">I never thought I'd end up as a developer. Back in college, I was studying mechanical engineering at K.L. University, drawing machine parts and calculating stress factors. But during my third year, I stumbled upon a Data Structures and Algorithms course that changed everything. I was hooked.</p>

                <p>While my classmates were designing engines, I was staying up late teaching myself to code. It paid off when I became the only mechanical engineering student in my class to land a software developer job after graduation. Looking back, I'm grateful for that mechanical background—it gave me a unique way of breaking down complex problems.</p>

                    The transition from mechanical engineering to code has given me a unique perspective—I approach software problems with an engineer's mindset.
                </div>

                <p>These days, I work at Beamx Techlabs, where I've grown from writing my first professional code to leading projects and designing systems. The journey hasn't always been smooth—I still remember staring at my screen at 2 AM, trying to debug a particularly nasty issue with a knowledge graph query. But those moments of struggle are what make the breakthroughs so satisfying.</p>

                <p>I fell in love with knowledge graphs the first time I saw how they connect information in ways that just make sense. There's something almost magical about watching relationships between data points reveal insights that would stay hidden in traditional databases. I've spent countless hours experimenting with different graph schemas, trying to map out everything from movie recommendations to complex business domains.</p>

                <p>I'm fascinated by how distributed systems work—these complex networks of services that somehow manage to work together despite all the things that could go wrong. Working with serverless architectures has been like solving an ever-evolving puzzle. How do you make sure everything stays consistent? What happens when something fails? These questions keep me up at night (in a good way).</p>

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of search algorithms with machine learning, and how these technologies can make vastly complex information landscapes navigable for everyone.</p>

                <p>My journey into serverless architecture started with a simple email service that grew into something much bigger. I've built systems that handle unexpected traffic spikes with ease, communicate through events, and recover gracefully when things go wrong. The best part? Watching something I built scale automatically without having to wake up to restart a server at 3 AM.</p>

                <p>I've built APIs that bring graph databases and document stores together, letting applications navigate complex relationships while still having the rich content people need. My favorite project involved modeling automotive data in a way that connected everything from manufacturers to specific features, making it possible to answer questions no one had even thought to ask yet.</p>

Five years later, I'm still learning something new almost daily. I've realized that knowing how to learn efficiently is far more valuable than any specific knowledge. Every new technology I pick up gives me a fresh perspective on problems I thought I already understood.</p>
